# Telebirr SDK Integration Fix

## Error Encountered

**Error Code**: -996  
**Error Message**: "Activity is not available"  
**Status**: false

```
the sdk response is: {status: false, code: -996, message: Activity is not available}
```

---

## Root Cause

The `telebirr_inapp_sdk` plugin requires a `FragmentActivity`, but `MainActivity` was extending `FlutterActivity`, which does not support fragments. The plugin attempts to cast the activity to `FragmentActivity`, which fails, resulting in a null activity reference.

**Plugin Code (TelebirrInappSdkPlugin.kt:119):**

```kotlin
activity = binding.activity as FragmentActivity  // Cast fails with FlutterActivity
```

---

## Solution

### Before (Not Working)

```kotlin
package com.example.yamfoods_customer_app

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity : FlutterActivity()
```

### After (Working)

```kotlin
package com.example.yamfoods_customer_app

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

// Use FlutterFragmentActivity so plugins that require a FragmentActivity
// (like telebirr_inapp_sdk) can safely cast the activity.
class MainActivity : FlutterFragmentActivity()
```

---

## Why It Works

- `FlutterFragmentActivity` extends `FragmentActivity`, which the plugin requires
- `FlutterActivity` extends `Activity` directly, causing the cast to fail
- `FlutterFragmentActivity` is a superset of `FlutterActivity` - all existing functionality is preserved

---

## Safety & Compatibility

✅ **Safe to use** - Official Flutter class, fully supported  
✅ **No breaking changes** - All Flutter functionality preserved  
✅ **Better compatibility** - Works with all plugins, including fragment-based ones  
✅ **No performance impact** - Same performance as `FlutterActivity`

## Notes for Future Development

- When integrating payment SDKs or plugins that use Android fragments, always use `FlutterFragmentActivity`
- This change is required for any plugin that internally uses `FragmentActivity`
- Common use cases: Payment SDKs (Telebirr, Stripe), Camera plugins, Image pickers
