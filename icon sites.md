Quick setup
After downloading:
Place files in assets/gebeta/markers/:

marker-driver.png
marker-destination.png
Update pubspec.yaml if needed (already configured)
Use in code: 'asset://assets/gebeta/markers/marker-restaurant.png'
Alternative: create custom markers
If you want custom markers:
Use Figma/Canva with your brand colors
Export as PNG with transparent background
Recommended size: 64x64px or 96x96px
Should I help you integrate the markers once you have them, or create a simple custom marker generator?
