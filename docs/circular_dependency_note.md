# Circular Dependency - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue (Previously)

There was a circular dependency between `dioClient` and auth providers:

- `dioClient` needs `authRepository` and `authLocalDataSource` (for AuthInterceptor)
- `authApiService` needs `dioClient`
- `authRepository` needs `authRemoteDataSource` which needs `authApiService`

## Solution (Implemented)

We resolved this by creating two Dio providers:

1. **`baseDioClientProvider`** - Dio instance without auth interceptor

   - Used for breaking the circular dependency
   - Contains: RetryInterceptor, LoggingInterceptor
   - No auth-related dependencies

2. **`dioClientProvider`** - Full Dio instance with all interceptors
   - Watches auth providers (`authRepository`, `authLocalDataSource`, `tokenValidator`)
   - Creates a new Dio instance based on `baseDioClient` configuration
   - Adds AuthInterceptor as the first interceptor
   - Contains: AuthInterceptor, RetryInterceptor, LoggingInterceptor

The key insight: `baseDioClient` doesn't depend on auth providers, so `authApiService` can use it. Then `dioClient` (which depends on auth providers) is created separately and used for all other API calls.

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Both providers are implemented and working correctly.
